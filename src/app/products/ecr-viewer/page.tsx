                  The eCR Viewer is a tool that aims to improve the usability of
                  electronic case reporting (eCR) data by displaying a summary
                  of key data contained in an eCR so that public health staff
                  can quickly find the information they need.

                  In user research with public health staff who review eCRs and
                  other case data, we've heard that eCR data is often difficult
                  to make sense of â€” it's like getting someone's entire medical
                  record dropped on your desk. The eCR Viewer aims to make
                  relevant information easier to find by displaying eCR data in
                  a way that's more intuitive.
