## Introducing PHDI
Introducing Data Integration Building Blocks
DIBBs are modular, open-source software that can be configured as a pipeline to clean, transform, and enrich data. We build cloud-enabled products that leverage DIBBs to provide the following benefits to public health jurisdictions:

- Better, higher quality data for use in data analysis
- Time-savings for public health staff thanks to reduced manual work 
- More usable data that makes case investigation easier 
- Automated data processing that streamlines data workflows 
- Flexible cloud deployment options, including free central hosting through CDC
