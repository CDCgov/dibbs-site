# Overview

The PHDI site is the landing page for the PHDI package. The goal is to be informative for different United States public health departments to understand the purpose of the PHDI package and the different building blocks. The site also links to various parts of the PHDI repo as well as other government pages to get involved. The static site uses the [NextJS framework](https://nextjs.org/).

## Design and Accessibility

The designs were created by the Skylight team using the [USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) framework. The USWDS framework includes accessibility designs that complies with [government standards](https://designsystem.digital.gov/documentation/accessibility/). In addition, the [Lighthouse CI](https://web.dev/lighthouse-ci/) is used to ensure accessibility from a programmatic standpoint.
